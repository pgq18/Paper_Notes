# TinyVLA: Towards Fast, Data-Efficient Vision-Language-Action Models for Robotic Manipulation

## What is the paper doing?

Is it proposing a new problem, solving an open problem, introducing a novel perspective or connection, or generalizing existing work? Does it open a new direction, or consolidate existing knowledge in a meaningful way?

## What are the core insight and main conclusions of the paper?
What is the central claim or argument? Are the assumptions made (explicit or implicit) reasonable and well-justified? Do they hold under scrutiny in real-world or practical settings?

## What are the key related works?

Which research groups are leading in this area? What are the seminal or most influential papers in this field? Try to identify foundational work published in top-tier venues (e.g., NeurIPS, ICML, CVPR, ACL, S&P, OSDI, IEEE Transactions, Nature/Science if applicable).

## What is the key technical insight—the “one” idea—behind the solution?

What is the crucial innovation or design choice that enables the method to work? Is it a new algorithm, architecture, theoretical analysis, or modeling assumption? How does it differ fundamentally from prior approaches?

## Do the experiments support the paper’s central claims?
What is the core experimental design—e.g., datasets, baselines, evaluation metrics, ablation studies? Are the results convincing and reproducible? What are the limitations of the experimental setup (e.g., narrow domains, synthetic data, scalability issues)?

## Overall, what are the contributions of the paper?
Does it introduce a new concept, framework, or problem formulation? Does it achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance? Does it address a practical or industry-relevant challenge? Does it bridge gaps between different fields? Also, critically assess its strengths and weaknesses.

## What questions remain open?
What future work does the paper inspire or leave behind? Are there deeper principles or more general formulations underlying the results? Could the conclusions be extended to broader settings? Has the paper truly resolved the problem it set out to address, or are there caveats, edge cases, or unresolved issues?
